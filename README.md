Small GUI application for sending TCP messages to a server.

Your observation is correct! I do not feel like learning Java/Kotlin to make an Android app!

## FAQ

> When connecting, I get "NoRouteToHostException; potential firewall issue"

The main reasons for this that I'm aware of are that
- There is an error with the network configuration, try `ping`ing the server to see if the
issue persists, and try connecting again if it pings successfully
- Incorrect address/server doesn't exist
